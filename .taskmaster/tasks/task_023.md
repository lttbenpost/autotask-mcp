**Title:** Implement Analytics Service Layer

**Status:** done

**Dependencies:** 5 ✓, 6 ✓

**Priority:** high

**Description:** Create AnalyticsService class with methods for customer profitability analysis, ticket trend detection, high-touch customer identification, and resource capacity forecasting.

**Details:**

Create analytics-service.ts in services/ directory implementing AnalyticsService class. Implement customerProfitabilityAnalysis() method that calculates revenue per customer using time entries, ticket costs, and contract values with configurable date ranges. Add ticketTrendDetection() method using moving averages and statistical analysis to identify patterns in ticket volume, resolution times, and priority distributions. Implement identifyHighTouchCustomers() method that analyzes interaction frequency, ticket volume, and support hours to score customers using weighted metrics. Create resourceCapacityForecasting() method that analyzes historical workload data, current assignments, and utilization rates to predict capacity needs. Include data aggregation utilities for time-series analysis, statistical calculations for trend detection, and caching mechanisms for expensive computations. Use the existing AutotaskService for data retrieval and MappingService for ID-to-name resolution. Implement proper error handling and logging throughout all analytics methods.

**Test Strategy:**

Create unit tests for each analytics method with mocked data scenarios covering various customer profiles, ticket patterns, and resource utilization levels. Test profitability calculations with different time ranges and revenue models. Verify trend detection algorithms identify upward/downward patterns and seasonal variations. Test high-touch customer scoring with edge cases like new customers and inactive accounts. Validate capacity forecasting accuracy using historical data splits. Include performance tests for large datasets and verify caching mechanisms reduce computation time. Test error handling for missing data and invalid parameters.
